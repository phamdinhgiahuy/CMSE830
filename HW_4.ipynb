    "### KDE and Rug Plots (from scratch!)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are earning some extra money working in a restaurant while you complete your data science degree. In a conversation with other employees, the topic of tips comes up: do people tip 15% or 20%? An \"argument\" breaks out before you interrupt and point out that there is a distribution of tips, not a fixed value. In fact, you propose that the distribution of tips is normally distributed. To your surprise, you learn that one of the waitresses is also a data scientist student who points out that there is no reason to believe that the distribution of tips is normal and that the mean and standard deviation have any meaning. You propose to answer these questions by building a KDE of tip data!\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úçüèª For this problem, do **not** use a library to compute the KDE - do it yourself using basic Python. Your plot will be similar to the one above. Follow these steps:\n",
    "* get the standard \"tips\" dataset (which is in Seaborn)\n",
    "* compute the percentage tip from the data, and store those values in an array\n",
    "* in `matplotlib`, plot a vertical line from 0 to 1 for each tip percentage (there are many ways to do this, but an easy way is to use [`vlines`](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.vlines.html)); you should have a vertical line marking each percentage tip in the dataset\n",
    "* adjust the figure so that you can view the data well, perhaps using something like `plt.figure(figsize=(20,5))`\n",
    "* from this plot, do you think that tips are normally distributed? why or why not?\n",
    "* write a function called `my_kde` that reads in three variables: the _x_ values you want to plot over (perhaps use `linspace` over the range of percentage tip), the array of percent tips _p_ you computed above and the width _w_ of the kernel; make your kernel have the form $$K(x,p) = \\exp(-(x - p)^2/2w^2)/(w\\sqrt{2\\pi})$$ and return the [sum of the kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation) over all of the tip percentages (note that this will be an array over the _x_ values)\n",
    "* plot your kde with the vertical lines you produced above - note that the vertical lines (if you made them from _0_ to _1_) will be a rug plot,\n",
    "* make several plots with different values of the width _w_ (perhaps in the range _0.2_ to _6_); which value of _w_ is best?\n",
    "* using NumPy, compute the mean and standard deviation of the percent tips, construct a normal distribution from those values and add that to your plot: this is the best normal distribution the data suggests and it many or may not look like the KDE (hint: `plt.plot(x_vals, 100*np.exp(-(x_vals - np.mean(tip_perc))**2/(2*np.var(tip_perc)))/(np.std(tip_perc)*np.sqrt(2*np.pi)))`)\n",
    "* if you make your width _w_ too large, does the KDE predict anything impossible?\n",
    "* finally, answer the question: do you think this is a normal distribution? Would you arrive at a different conclusion depending on which width _w_ you pick? What is your conclusion to the original conversation in the restaurant? Do you see outliers? (Put discussion in a markdown cell.)\n",
