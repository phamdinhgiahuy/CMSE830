    "  4. What preliminary studies have you done? Do they look promising?\n",
    "  5. What will your web app do? How will this be useful to people?\n",

You could imagine a scenario in which you work at a large company and are the data scientist. You are asked to design and build a web app for a mostly non-technical manager with the goal that they engage with the data as a \"dashboard\", perhaps as a way to report to them on what your team has done and why it is interesting an important. Thus, it is important that you understand the narrative that goes with your data, choose the best visualization to display your ideas, and layout the app in a way that is logical for a user you have never met.\n",
